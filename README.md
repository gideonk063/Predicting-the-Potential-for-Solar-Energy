# Predicting the Potential for Solar Energy Based on Location
## Gideon Karasek
### Overview
In this project, I will be attempting to predict the percent of houses that are considered suitable for solar energy in a given census-tract. 

### Data
The data is taken from Google Project Sunroof. It includes positional data(longitude and latitude) and average yearly energy potential- calculated based on historic cloud cover, potential number of solar panels that could fit on a given building, potential of other buildings blocking sunlight, etc.
